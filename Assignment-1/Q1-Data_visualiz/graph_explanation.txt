Here source represents the source node and the target node corresponds to each node the source node is connected to. It is a directed graph and hence a connection of node A to B does not necessarily imply connection of node B to A. A forced atlas layout has been chosen with straight edges. This groups linked nodes more closer pushing out non-linked nodes. Here, the labelling is done based on the node size. The size of the node is based on degree of the node. Thus, node with ID 281957 with maximum number of edges, around 31 edges; is the largest node. Labelling of nodes have been filtered; labelling only nodes with more than 4 edges. Clustering of the network into modules is done based on modularity class. And the colouring of each node is also based on that with node having ID 281957 with highest modularity class coloured light pink.
